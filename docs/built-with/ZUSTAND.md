## [Zustand](https://https://zustand.docs.pmnd.rs/)

Zustand is a small, fast, and scalable bearbones state management solution. Zustand has a comfy API based on hooks. It isn't boilerplatey or opinionated, but has enough convention to be explicit and flux-like.

```bash
npm install zustand immer
npm run update-deps
```
